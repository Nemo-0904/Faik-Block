## 📝Description

- In today's fast-changing technological world, fake products are a big problem. They're not just about losing money; they can also be dangerous and hurt a brand's reputation. To address  this issue , we use a smart system that uses blockchain tech to spot fake product.
- Blockchain, known for its decentralized and immutable nature, provides a robust platform for tracking and verifying the authenticity of products throughout their lifecycle.
- This system developed here provides a platform for verifying the Originality of the product.

## 🔮Future Scope


-  COMPANYS CAN REGISTRATION IN THEIR OWN CURRENCY: It will be possible to Use currency depending on the country. There wont be any compulsion to use standard currencies only.
-  While registering, we will take 5% of the product's cost as fee for using our platform. 

## 💸Applications

Authentication of Luxury Goods: 
Luxury brands use blockchain to authenticate products, assigning each item a unique digital certificate stored on the blockchain. Consumers can verify authenticity by accessing this certificate, helping to combat counterfeiters.

Pharmaceutical Traceability: The pharmaceutical industry can implement blockchain-based systems to track the production, distribution, and sale of drugs. By recording each transaction on the blockchain, stakeholders can ensure the integrity of the supply chain and prevent the distribution of counterfeit or substandard medications.

Authentication of Artwork and Collectibles: Artists and collectors can use blockchain technology to verify the authenticity of artwork and collectibles. By registering each piece on the blockchain, stakeholders can create a tamper-proof record of ownership and provenance, reducing the risk of fraud and forgery in the art market.

Overall, the application of a Fake Block Identification System using blockchain technology has the potential to enhance authenticity verification across a wide range of industries, providing stakeholders with a secure and transparent way to verify the authenticity of goods, documents, and identities.

MONETISATION: 

Monetizing a Fake Block Identification System using blockchain technology involves offering services or solutions related to authenticity verification for a fee. Here are several monetization strategies for such a system:

1. A total of 5% is taken from the products cost. This is will be a part of the registration and usage fee. No separate fees will later be taken.

## 🛠Project Setup

- STEP 1: Install Node.js and npm: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications in JavaScript and run them on the server. It includes a rich library of modules, known as npm (Node Package Manager), that enables developers to add functionality to their applications quickly and easily. It is widely used for web application development, building networked applications, and developing server-side scripts.
- STEP 2: Install Metamask Extension MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that provides an interface for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store, manage, and send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens, as well as interact with dApps in a user-friendly way.
- STEP 3: Configure a Metamask Account
- STEP 4: Navigate to the repository and clone it: Clone our GitHub Respository
